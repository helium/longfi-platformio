# Helium Basic Example

This is a very basic example of a CubCell to Helium embedded project that uses PlatformIO as the development IDE rather than the Arduino IDE.
This version will join the Helium network and periodic send a 4 byte message to the Helium network.

A quick start guide that can be used along with this sample can be found within the Helium developer documents within the Quickstart
area at "Devices" - "LongFi Arduino" - "Heltec CubeCell Board", currently found within the repositories at:
[Heltec CubeCell Board](https://developer.helium.com/devices/arduino-quickstart/heltec-cubecell-board).
