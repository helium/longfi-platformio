## Developing Embedded Applications Targeting the Helium Network with PlatformIO

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products.

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)provides developers with a modern integrated development environment \([Cloud & Desktop IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/index.html#ide)\) that works cross-platform to:
* support many different software development kits \(SDKs\)
* provide access to various [Frameworks](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html#frameworks)
* allow sophisticated debugging \([PIO Unified Debugger](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debugging.html#piodebug)\)
* enable unit testing \([PIO Unit Testing](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/unit-testing.html#unit-testing)\)
* support automated code analysis \([PIO Check](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-check.html#piocheck)\)
* enable remote management \([PIO Remote](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-remote.html#pioremote)\).

It is architected to maximize flexibility and choice by developers, who can use either graphical or command line editors \([PlatformIO Core \(CLI\)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html#piocore)\), or both.

If you are used to developing using the Arduino IDE but constantly feel constrained by the environment, you are going to love what [PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)opens up for you.

# LongFi PlatformIO

Here you will find a getting started guide as well as a collection of PlatformIO project examples which transmit data across the Helium network via several target development boards. NOTE: Some examples may require additional hardware.


 The [PlatformIO Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide is intended to be somewhat generic in nature. While it does detail a specific target device one can easily substitute  your own target device. Any device specific additions or suggestions can be found within the README inside the sample project.
