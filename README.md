## Developing Embedded Applications Targeting the Helium Network with PlatformIO

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products.

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)provides developers with a modern integrated development environment \([Cloud & Desktop IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/index.html#ide)\) that works cross-platform to:
* support many different software development kits \(SDKs\)
* provide access to various [Frameworks](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html#frameworks)
* allow sophisticated debugging \([PIO Unified Debugger](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debugging.html#piodebug)\)
* enable unit testing \([PIO Unit Testing](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/unit-testing.html#unit-testing)\)
* support automated code analysis \([PIO Check](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-check.html#piocheck)\)
* enable remote management \([PIO Remote](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-remote.html#pioremote)\).

It is architected to maximize flexibility and choice by developers, who can use either graphical or command line editors \([PlatformIO Core \(CLI\)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html#piocore)\), or both.

If you are used to developing using the Arduino IDE but constantly feel constrained by the environment, you are going to love what [PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)opens up for you.

 
Here you will find a collection of code examples using the PlatformIO platform running under Visual Studio Code.

# LongFi Platformio

Here you will find a collection of Arduino sketch examples of transmitting on the Helium network with several LoRaWAN development boards. Some examples require additional hardware. Please see the README in the example directories for instructions.
